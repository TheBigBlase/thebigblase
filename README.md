Howdy, im Violette ! 

i'm an 22 y/o üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏ègirl studying IT in Polytech Annecy, and Sherbrooke university.
i've learned C/C++, JS/TS doing silly projects on my own, which you can find a bunch here
also did a bunch of web CTFs / crackmes

I learn a lot by doing some random stuff and messing around, so pretty much nothing works here lmao

I use another git server at [bigblase.xyz](https://git.bigblase.xyz/violette), just so stuff feels
more personnal & i *own* the data
