Hi, i'm maxime paulin

i'm an IT student in Polytech Annecy, IDU speciality 
i've learned C/C++, JS/TS doing silly projects on my own, which you can find a bunch here
also did a bunch of web CTFs / crackmes

a lot of things here are waiting to be updated or abandonned. Their purpose was mainly to learn, having them working is a plus

i learn a lot by doing some random stuff, not by actually following tutorials, hence the state of a lot of projects here
